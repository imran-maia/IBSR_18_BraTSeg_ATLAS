**Abstract:** The segmentation of brain tissues in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is vital for investigating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This process goes beyond accurate diagnosis, enabling quantitative analysis and fostering advancements in personalized medicine and targeted therapies. This project explores the effectiveness of statistical-based approaches such as Probabilistic ATLAS with different rigid and non-rigid image registration techniques in segmenting MRI brain tissues using the IBSR18 dataset. Performance assessment reveals the superior capability of Probabilistic ATLAS using Affine Registration, achieving an average mean Dice Score of 0.720 ± 0.036. Noteworthy, 2D nnU-Net excels in Hausdorff Distance (6.349 ± 0.343) and Absolute Volumetric Difference (06.349 ± 10.543).
